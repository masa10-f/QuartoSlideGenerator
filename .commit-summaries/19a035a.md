## Natural Language Summary Generation Feature

This commit implements a comprehensive commit summary generation system for the quarto-task-slides skill, enabling teams to create more accessible and stakeholder-friendly presentations.

**What was added:**
- Three flexible summary modes: Template (extracts from commit messages), AI (generates via Claude API), and Manual (loads custom summaries)
- Smart extraction logic that pulls structured information from commit message bodies
- AI-powered summary generation using Claude API for comprehensive analysis
- Support for manual override with custom markdown files

**Why this matters:**
- Makes technical changes understandable for non-technical stakeholders
- Streamlines sprint reviews and retrospectives by focusing on "what" and "why" rather than just diffs
- Provides flexibility for different team workflows and preferences
- Maintains backward compatibility with the default "none" mode

**Key highlights:**
- No breaking changes - existing workflows continue to work
- Comprehensive documentation with usage examples for all three modes
- Example files included for easy testing and adoption
- Configurable via simple command-line flags
